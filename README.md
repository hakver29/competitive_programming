# Competitive Programming

Framework and solutions to various programming challenges on different online platforms. The aim is to create a plug-and-play setup for solving programming challenges in any language of choice.


## Project structure 

Each online platform has folders with programming solutions in each programming language.

```markdown
- [Platform1]
    - [Language1]
    - [Language2]
    - [Language3]
- [Platform2]
    ...
```

### Rust
Add the rust-folder to the online platform folder by writing
`cargo new rust vcs=none`

The solution can be tested by writing 
`cargo test`
