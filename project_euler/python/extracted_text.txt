•Information containing any historical information, data or analysis should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of any future performance, analysis, forecast or
prediction. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
•The Information should not be relied on and is not a substitute for the skill, judgment and experience of the user, its management, employees, advisors and/or clients
when making investment and other business decisions. All Information is impersonal and not tailored to the needs of any person, entity or group of persons.
•None of the Information constitutes an offer to sell (or a solicitation of an offer to buy), any security, financial product or other investment vehicle or any trading
strategy.
•It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Exposure to an asset class or trading strategy or other category represented by an index is only available through third
party investable instruments (if any) based on that index. MSCI does not issue, sponsor, endorse, market, offer, review or otherwise express any opinion regarding
any fund, ETF, derivative or other security, investment, financial product or trading strategy that is based on, linked to or seeks to provide an investment return related
to the performance of any MSCI index (collectively, “Index Linked Investments”). MSCI makes no assurance that any Index Linked Investments will accurately track
index performance or provide positive investment returns. MSCI Inc. is not an investment adviser or fiduciary and MSCI makes no representation regarding the
advisability of investing in any Index Linked Investments.
•Index returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. MSCI maintains and calculates indexes, but does not manage actual assets.
Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or Index Linked Investments.
The imposition of these fees and charges would cause the performance of an Index Linked Investment to be different than the MSCI index performance.
•The Information may contain back tested data. Back-tested performance is not actual performance, but is hypothetical. There are frequently material differences
between back tested performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any investment strategy.
•Constituents of MSCI equity indexes are listed companies, which are included in or excluded from the indexes according to the application of the relevant index
methodologies. Accordingly, constituents in MSCI equity indexes may include MSCI Inc., clients of MSCI or suppliers to MSCI. Inclusion of a security within an MSCI
index is not a recommendation by MSCI to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice.
•Data and information produced by various affiliates of MSCI Inc., including MSCI ESG Research Inc. and Barra LLC, may be used in calculating certain MSCI
indexes. More information can be found in the relevant index methodologies on www.msci.com.
•MSCI receives compensation in connection with licensing its indexes to third parties. MSCI Inc.’s revenue includes fees based on assets in Index Linked Investments.
Information can be found in MSCI Inc.’s company filings on the Investor Relations section of www.msci.com.
•MSCI ESG Research Inc. is a Registered Investment Adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and a subsidiary of MSCI Inc. Except with respect to any
applicable products or services from MSCI ESG Research, neither MSCI nor any of its products or services recommends, endorses, approves or otherwise expresses
